# Starter Code for Farkel Project

## PLU CSCE 390

Contains two Eclipse projects: a client and a server.  Both use Maven for build and dependency
management.

To run the server use:

```
mvn jetty:run
```

To run the client use:

```
mvn exec:java
```

You may also need to update the `exec.mainClass` in `pom.xml`.
